	<p> Hi Ash I know you said you didn’t want anything but I technically didn’t get you anything I made you something only my big brain could think of. This is a small website just dedicated to people who love you, I hope it bring you a smile if you start to feel down. </p>

		Happy birthday Ash this is a compilation of all the memories you have had with people over the years, you have been such a good friend to me that I just wanted to make you a little something to remember your 18th birthday. On the other page there is a compilation of different memory’s you have made with people from when you were little to now (still small though). I also just wanted to put a little something in about how strong and confident you have become ever since you came out, so many people are here to support you and see you grow (mentally not physically). I am so proud of the person you have become and what you stand for, you truly are my best friend and you mean the world to me happy 18th birthday dude I hope you enjoy this website as well as the day.
